# On-The-Move

On-The-Move is a web application designed for travelers who want to share their journey. It allows them to post the different stages of their trip, including their location and photos.

It is dedicated to travelers who choose eco-friendly means of transportation (but anyone can use it; it is free and open source, and it does not collect any user data or track users).

We believe it is important to share your eco-friendly travel experiences, as this is a good way to multiply the positive impact of your eco-friendly choice. When you spend 3 days on a train instead of 2 hours on a plane, you already significantly reduce your carbon emissions (1 ton, in fact), but this impact can be multiplied if it encourages others to do the same.

When they see your daily posts on On-The-Move, your friends and family may go from thinking, “That's crazy, why would I do that?” to “Hey, that actually sounds like fun!”.

They may not do it right away, but at least the seed will have been planted, and it will grow.

So go inspire people! And have a nice trip :)
