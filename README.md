# On The Move

On The Move lets you post your trip steps, including pictures.

This application is ready-to-use, it is free and open source.

This app does not use any tracker of any kind and your data will be stored in your GitHub account (you will be invited to create one if you don't have one), and you can delete it whenever you want.
